# Assessment 3 - Folio Requirements. 

The folio demonstrates your experimentation and engagement with the form during the class. Full documentation should be on github with PDF compilation (30 pages max) submitted to Canvas with live links. 

The folio needs to address the criteria as outlined in the class handbook: 

1. Objectives
   - All the required professional documents are present (GitHub account, an artist's statement and a personal webpage or artist CV)
   - Coversheet for the developed creative work is complete
   - Success of the creative work in meeting the proposal or documented revised objectives
   - Documentation of any changes between the proposal and the developed creative work 
2. Evidence
   - Folio contains a wide range of exercises completed in class as per the weekly instructions in the class README
   - Quality of the developed creative work
3. Annotations
   - Developed creative work as a critical engagement with the form 
   - Critical engagement with works of electronic literature and readings as specified throughout semester in the class README
   - Week 1 350-500 words on works from the Electronic Literature Collection
   - Week 3 500-750 words on Defining Electronic Literature 
   - Week 5 350 -500 words: What do you think of Aarsethâ€™s concept of Ergotic Literature? 
   - Week 6 250 to 300 words (minimum) on previous student works considered in class
5. Reflection
   - Your artist statement
   - Reflection on the class and how your practice has developed 
   - Reflections on the class exercises weekly as specified in the class README.
   - Reflections on your developed creative work 
6. Presentation
   - Presentation of the folio
   - Presentation of the developed creative work
7. Referencing
   - Consistent referencing using **APA 7** confirmed and changed in rubric (NOT Harvard) 

Ensure that you read the [digital writing folio assessment description in the class handbook](./class-handbook.md).

**What should be in my digital folio repository?** Your digital folio should document all your activity and engagement with class exercises and learning activities over the semester such as links to your digital experiments completed in class and short reflections on those experiments, and reflections on key readings as outlined in the README.md file. Try to capture as much as you can in your folio. If you had a few iterations of your final project or experimented with techniques you did not use in your final piece; the folio is the place to record this with reflections and/or links to the experiments.

**For the submission to Canvas, the PDF document should include:**

- Your name
- An artist statement/bio (if this is already included in an artist CV or your website or GitHub repository, still have it here, but it can be the same).
- A 500-word reflection on your key learning from the course and how your practice has developed as evidenced by your final creative work (if this is included in your GitHub digital writing folio, still have it here too).
- An link to your artist website that serves as a CV (e.g. artist bio and publications).
- A link to your GitHub account and your digital writing folio GitHub repository. 
- Screenshots and working links to your digital experiments, including: the coding playground where you have edited each of the poems and applied styling changes, your remixed "To Make a Dadaist Poem", and a Twine game that at a minimum has a working image map which links to passages. Optionally, you may include links to Bitsy and Inform games.
- Additional pages to your submission document should include reading responses as specified throughout semester in the class README.me. WIP reflections on your key learning during the course, and experiences workshopping your creative project. 
- Any documentation on the development of your creative work with any scans of any designs and notes.
- [Coversheet for your developed creative work](./coversheet-for-developed-creative-work.md)

Please note that when submitting your PDF document through Canvas, the max page count for your submission is 30 pages. We will not assess work beyond this limit, however, we will be combing through your GitHub repositories for your reflections, code and other evidence of engagement. Make good use of your repositories `.ReadMe` files if you want to leave us notes explaining the purpose of the repo. Use the 30 pages to cover the required information as set out above, but also use it to capture any other highlights of your learning experience: screenshots of Miro maps, scans of your ideation process from your journals, iterations and breakthroughs.
