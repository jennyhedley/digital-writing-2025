## Before Week 1

Read (on top of the weekly readings):
1. The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
2. The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
3. The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
4. The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the ["Play IF card"](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/).

- [The Electronic Literature Collections](https://collection.eliterature.org/)
- [Woollahra Digital Literary Award](https://www.woollahra.nsw.gov.au/Library/Digital-literary-award)
  
### Reading 
*Requirement for final folio - 350-500 words on the below. 

Read a few works from each volume of the [Electronic Literature Collection](https://collection.eliterature.org/):

* [Volume 1 (October 2006)](https://collection.eliterature.org/1/)
* [Volume 2 (February 2011)](https://collection.eliterature.org/2/)

Select one work from each volume that you read and for each write:

* What makes the work a piece of digital writing
* A personal response (whether you liked it, how it made you feel &c)

## GitHub

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. Do the ["Hello World" exercise](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Digital Writing Folio

Create a public repository with a `README` called `digital-writing-folio`.

On the main page of the repository you will see a button called "Add file".

1. Select "Add file"
2. Select "Create new file" from the dropdown that appears
3. At the top where you can see "Name your file..." type in `readings.md`
4. Scroll down to the bottom and select "Commit new file"
5. Repeat the above steps to add `exercises.md`

Look at the [example digital writing folio](https://github.com/blidau/digital-writing-folio). This should give you an idea of what the folio should initially look like.

On the example digital writing folio click on the "README.md". You should see a button that looks like "<>" just above the content. Select that button to see the formatting on the page. You can follow this technique for all the pages if you need to see the formatting used. Also read the reference for [basic writing and formatting syntax on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Edit the `exercises.md` page you just created in your digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions, you answered earlier.

## Write a Bio Note 

Write a 100-word biographical note. Use the questions you answered above as starting points. 
- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
Add the biographical note to the `README.md` of your GitHub digital writing folio repository.

## Intro to the Coding Playground

- Create an account on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) using your GitHub login credentials
- Remix this code: [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground)

# Week 2 - for use in class

This Wednesday we will be working in the [coding playground](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground) that you began to remix last week. 

If you missed out on the first week of classes, please make sure that you have set up a GitHub account, have signed into Glitch.com using your GitHub credentials so that the accounts are linked, that you follow the exercises above including Hello World (if you get lost, find a YouTube tutorial) and setting up your Digital Writing folio, that you're familiar with the documentation in this GitHub repository including the [class handbook](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/class-handbook.md), and that you are up to date on the class readings. Also be sure to share your GitHub username with Jenny and Lucinda if you have not done so already.

In class this week we will learn step-by-step how to make changes to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You will learn to import fonts of your choosing into the stylesheet; how to edit text, emojis and images; how to set background colours and apply various style changes. You will also learn how to edit textual arrays in order to fuel combinatory poetry which is pseudo-randomly generated. You are not expected to know how to do any of these things yet. If you have to miss out on this Wednesday class for any reason, then you should spend at least a few hours completing [free coding tutorials](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-basic-website.md#free-resources-for-learning-web-development) such as Codeacademy and FreeCodeCamp.

Here are some miscellaneous resources that you will find helpful as we code today:

- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Hex colour codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) 
- Check if your [colour contrast is accessible](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- [Royalty-free images](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Emojis](https://tools.picsart.com/text/emojis/)
- [GIFs](https://giphy.com/)
- [ChatGPT for troubleshooting code](https://chat.openai.com/)

# Week 3 - for use in class

## Monday 17th March

This Monday we will finish working in the [coding playground](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground) which we remixed. In class, we will remix the last three poems, as follows, then publish our coding playgrounds via GitHub Pages. 

It is important that you engage with these exercises, as Jenny and Lucinda will expect to see these published experiments when you submit your folio at the end of semester, which forms half of your marks. It is important to document your learning and your engagement with coding, as you figure out the technical possibilities for what your final project will look like. Even if you choose not to go with HTML/CSS/JS for your project, it is the most basic programming syntax which fuels nearly every online literary journal and is therefore worth being exposed to. If you do not yet have an author website - another requirement of the folio - building one on Glitch and publishing it on GitHub Pages is a simple and free mode of fulfilling this requirement. There will be further opportunities later in the semester to build author sites.

If you are absent from class, be sure to complete the following exercises that we will do in Monday's class:

- The 'Garfield' poem is a form of combinatory poetry that operates within a constraint. In this case, clicking the 'remix' button results in the placeholder text being replaced with three haikus. These haikus are populated from arrays of poetic phrases that are five syllables long - from the `const fiveSyllables =` array in the script.js file - and seven syllables long - from the `const sevenSyllables =` array. Edit these arrays to make haiku of your own, enclosingou will each line of five or seven syllables within parenthesis, followed by a single comma. Next be sure to change the placeholder text in the index.html file in the `<div class="cardHaiku">` area. Also be sure to apply new style properties (font, font colour, background colour, etc.) in the corresponding `.cardHaiku` class on the style.css file. 
- The 'SEARCHING' poem is a way to play with the auto-complete function of a search engine. Inspect your own browser history, or turn to Google or another search engine, to investigate a particular topic. You can either follow your own interests or exploit Google's autocomplete function to create your own database of search results - just make sure that you have at least one result for every letter of the alphabet. You will enclose each line of search results within parenthesis, followed by a single comma, in the `const words =` array on the script.js file. Test it out by typing a single letter in the website preview, in the search box.
- The 'Dystopian Dreams' poem is modified from a digital poetry exercise created by Benjamin Laird, which modified code from Nick Monfort's seminal [Taroko Gorge](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/) which has famously been remixed again and again. Under `<div class="cardPoem">` on the index.html file, give the poem a new title. Then on the script.js file, edit the words or phrases within the `const subjects =`, `verbs` and `objects` arrays. Unlike the previous two exercises which required you to format each word or phrase like `"this example",`, this time the `.split` function is used as a shortcut, which allows you to simply separate phrases in the array with a comma.

Once you have finished these exercises, be sure to click TOOLS -> IMPORT/EXPORT -> EXPORT TO GITHUB then put in your username/repositoryname to push your changes to your GitHub repository. Then, once in GitHub, view that repository and follow the green buttons: COMPARE & PULL REQUEST, CREATE PULL REQUEST, MERGE PULL REQUEST, CONFIRM MERGE.

Next we will publish our code on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site). You can follow the instructions in the link or follow along in class. *Jenny will clarfify this in class Monday Week 4 there was a bug in the process.

Finally, let's reflect on our remixed versions of Nick Monfort's poems. Edit the edit `exercises.md` page in your GitHub digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions:

- What aspects of the remix are the same?
- What aspects of the remix are different?
- Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

Now that we have completed the technical HTML/CSS/JS portion of our learning, reflect also on these questions:

- How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1? 
- Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?

Next Monday we will begin to look at Twine, a popular platform for creating branching, choose-your-own-adventure style literature. In advance of this, think about what story you would like to tell, that could make use of Twine's branching mode of storytelling. You may already have an unpublished work-in-progress on your hard drive, or maybe you will be inspired to create something new.
 
# Wednesday 19th March (for use in class and reading after class)

## Defining Electronic Literature

Edit the `readings.md` page in your digital writing folio and add the following questions below. Answer these questions with reference to Week 1 & 2 readings (you can include anything from week 3 if you wish but W1&2 are probably most relevant). This passage should be 500 - 750 words. 

- What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
- How are those elements meaningful?
- How are the works read differently from print literature?
- How is electronic literature different from print literature?
- What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?

## Algorithm and Constraint

## Questions: 
- What is an algorithm? What is a constraint? 
- Can you think of ways you might already be using thesein your writing? (e.g., tools, techniques or processes that constrain and sytematise the way you write)?
- Why were the Oupilo writers so interested in the intersection of maths and literature?
- How does algorthmic writing make us think differently about authorship? 

### Pen and Paper

Use pen and paper in applying the following processes and constraints. Take a photo of the results or transcribe them and add them to your folio.

#### To Make a Dadaist Poem

Follow the instructions for Tristan Tzara's ["To Make a Dadaist Poem"](https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/tzara.html).

#### Lipograms

Rewrite a very short piece of writing for each of the following constraints:

- The letter e
- Any other letter
- All the following letters: b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t, and y (prisoner's constraint)

#### Mesostics

Decide on a mesostic word. Rewrite a short piece of writing using this word as the spine word.

#### N+7

Replace every noun in a short piece of writing with the seventh noun that is found after it in a dictionary.

Vary this technique (e.g. N+9).

#### Constraint and Process

- Create a constraint (a restriction on your writing such as not using a letter (lipogram) or using a set number of syllables)
- Create a process (a process for creating writing such as picking the third word of each page of a book)

### Code

#### Remix "To Make a Dadaist Poem"

- If you haven't done so already, create a [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) account by signing up with your GitHub account and link your GitHub account
- Select "Remix on Glitch" on ["To Make a Dadaist Poem"](https://to-make-a-dadaist-poem.glitch.me)
- Create a repository in GitHub for the remix
- Change the article text (use your own text, text from a newspaper article or from a book on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/))
- Change the line length
- Export to GitHub after each change
- For your final assessment, add a link to your Glitch project in your digital writing folio

#### Remix N+7 
<ins>*Optional exercise as we didn't get through it in class.</ins>

- Select "Remix on Glitch" on ["N+7"](https://n-plus-7.glitch.me)
- Create a repository in GitHub for the remix
- Change the article text
- Change the difference in number of nouns
- Export to GitHub after each change
- For your final assessment, add a link to your Glitch project in your digital writing folio

### Taroko Gorge(s)
<ins>*Optional exercise as we didn't get through it in class.</ins>

Select a remixed [Taroko Gorge](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/) and edit the `exercises.md` page in your digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions:

- What aspects of the remix are the same?
- What aspects of the remix are different?
- Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

# Week 4 - for use in class

## Monday 24th March

Please note that your first assessment has a new due date. Presentations will take place during class next Monday the 31st, however **you are expected to upload your slide presentation onto Canvas by this Friday 28th March 11.59pm**. If you require an extension, you must apply for an extension through the Canvas portal.

Last week when we deployed our coding playgrounds using GitHub pages we ran into errors. Jenny has thoroughly investigated this and the issue is related to certain JavaScript functionality around "event listeners", which we use frequently in digital poetics but which in real world (aka capitalism and the vectors of communication run by tech oligarchs) carry the potential for security risks. Our poems, however, pose no security risks to us, and so the way to get around this will be to create an account with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) using your GitHub credentials. Other options for free website deployment include [Render](https://render.com/) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). Jenny will demonstrate in class how to then deploy your coding playground website through Vercel. Knowing how to do this will make life easy later, when it comes time to publish our Twine stories and websites.

Today we will focus on learning Twine, a user-friendly platform for writing interactive fiction. Jenny will begin with a 1990s example of pioneering hypertext fiction before sharing contemporary examples of Twine stories published in literary journals, and Lucinda will follow up in the Wednesday class with student examples so you'll have an idea of the level of work you might be expected to produce.

Please refer to our class [Twine resources](/resources-twine.md) throughout the semester as we continue to learn new Twine functionality bit by bit. You can also refer to Twine's official [basic concepts documentation](https://twinery.org/reference/en/getting-started/basic-concepts.html).

If you are missing the Monday class, you will need to follow the instructions in the class [Twine resources](/resources-twine.md) up to the section on [changing the story stylesheet](/resources-twine.md#change-the-story-stylesheet). We will continue learning Twine functionality on Monday 7th April - with a focus on background images/scaling images/adding audio - and Monday 14th when we will learn how to insert image maps into Twine before we move onto Bitsy games.

The following peer-reviewed article is not at all required reading, but if you choose to use Twine for your final project, you may be insterested in reading about how Mia Francesca-Jones used [Twine as a tool to expand life writing practice about place and space](https://textjournal.scholasticahq.com/article/57762).

Tips for Ass 1 Case Study Presentation 

### Assessment Criteria - Content: (40%) ###

**Assignment Instruction**: Prepare a case study of a work of electronic literature. How does it work? What does it do? How does the reader interact with the piece? What kinds of questions does it raise for you?  

Tip: Lead with interest and curiosity. It’s ok to have questions about E-Lit theory and practice at this early stage it’s complex! Don’t feel you need to know it all.

**Assignment Instruction**: You should include an analysis of form, to offer your lab group some context.

Tip: This is not a 3000 word essay and so you won’t be able to go into enormous detail in your analysis. In fact I have removed the word 'detailed' from this instruction. Make sure you know the case study very well (in detail) but choose only the most relevant points in your analysis. You don’t have time to outline everything there is to say about it. 

**Assignment Instruction**: Your presentation should briefly address ‘What is conveyed’ by the digital work and tell us something about the artist and where the artist sits in terms of industry or material practice.

Tip: Use specific terms from the field: remixed, kinetic, hypertextual essaying and poetry, interactive fiction, programmatic texts - the readings are full of great lists of the hybridity and diversity of form, use them to help you if you are not sure about the terminology. Locate it in the field: ‘Generational’ definers will be helpful here. This is where you should include some refrences to the Required Readings from Weeks 1-3. E-Lit is full of hybridity. These texts can not be clearly pinned down as belonging to one type. Is it on the spectrum of a game/story? E-Lit/Digital Art? what kind of hybridity does it present? (as relevant).
This point from the Week 3 Reading by Memmott (2006 p.293) is useful to think about (you don’t need to provide a long reference like this I just thought I’d point it this out FYI)  

- “These terms are liquid delimiters for creative cultural practice through applied technology. The context in which any given term is used provides the framework for its definition, however tentative or temporary. The terms are conveniences—(perhaps) for the sake of argument.”

- ## Week 7

### Monday class – 14th April

Today we will look at interactive fiction in games. You are not required to include games code from today in your folio. We understand that you have experimented with so much code already. 

We will play through a number of Bitsy examples (which will be added to the repo later) and discuss our thoughts. 

#### Class discussion

-How does Bitsy's technical constraint of 8x8 pixel art and limited colour palettes affect narrative possibilities and expression? In particular, how have these been used to elicit emotional response to themes around memory and grief?
-In what ways do spatial navigation and environmental storytelling function differently in Bitsy games compared to other e-lit forms? What does this ask of the reader/player?
-How can we make use various game features (e.g., character interactions triggering text, having scenes “loop” differently with each subsequent play) to make a game “literary”, with a compelling emotional timbre?

We will play with the online Bitsy Game Maker, drawing upon this new class [games resources page](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-games.md). 

Since Assessment Two is due right after the upcoming break, think about whether there is any tech that you need to know to make your prototype for your presentation. We will have time in class today to troubleshoot any of the coding that we have covered so far. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c32f7f8-827a-41aa-a3ea-c6aef1f95a3f)


**Assignment Instruction**: You should then spend most of your time unpacking 'How does it happen?' whatever it is that this digital work does. Ask yourself: how a reader interacts with the work or whether they can; the relationship between imagery and text; how the text changes between readings; how movement acts in the work; the structure of the work; the technologies used; the relationship between space and time in the work (explicit or implicit); the relationship between the work and the browser. 

Tip: You will need to understand the case study well enough to make relevant  choices here about the most important aspects that back up your understanding of the work and how it is informing your own practice.  

**Assignment Instruction**: Share with us what you have learnt that might relate to your own practice or potential output.

Tip: Remember to tell us about your own practice - how does this case study relate? This is a really important and one of the most interesting part of the assignment. Bring it back to your own practice.  

**Assignment Instruction**: Please leave the class with 1 question at the end of the talk. The question should be open-ended and meant to make us think about our own practice, making or reading digital literature.

Tip: There are so many interesting questions that E-Lit raises: what are the most relevant and pressing for the way you think about your own practice of making and reading? 

### Assessment Criteria - Use of supporting materials (20%) ###
**Assignment Instruction**: Support materials are essential - a clear Powerpoint presentation so we can follow along.

Tip: Using presentation materials in a sophisticated way means making considered choices about what you say verbally, and what you show visually, and using the strengths of both mediums. Remember the cliché “a picture says a thousand words” – use visuals to show things that would take a lot of words to describe. Equally,  presentation slides should not be loaded with text. A few wordy slides is fine but don’t try to fit an essay onto a Powerpoint. Any presentation platform you can submit to canvas is fine. You don't have to use Powerpoint.

### Assessment Criteria - Delivery: (20%) and Volume and Clarity of Expression (10%) ###

Tip: lead with interest and curiosity. If you are interested and curious your audience is very likely to be also. 

Tip: Speak at a moderate speed. A rule of thumb is 100 words a minute. 

Tip: Prepare. Rehearse and time yourself.  

Tip: make sure it runs to time: aim for 4 be done by 4.30. You will be timed and stopped at 5mins.


## Week 5 

## Monday class Assessment 1 Case Study Presesentations

## Wednesday April 2

Hypertext fiction: concepts, precursors, critical framing. Below are some links and references to assist your thinking and understanding of hypertext.
As we have learned, hypertext was one of the first innovations in E-Literature and remains an important aspect of this diverse field.

Print Precursors: 
- Marc Saporta, Composition No. 1 (1961)
- Vladimir Nabokov, Pale Fire (1962)
- Julio Cortázar, Hopscotch (1963)
- BS Johnson, The Unfortunates (1969)
- Choose Your Own Adventure (1979–1998)

Technological Precursors (not neccessarily literary)
- Memex, Vannevar Bush, ["As We May Think" 1945](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)

### Reading 
**Requirement for final folio - 350-500 words on the below (this can be done any time this week)**

This week's Required Reading (Aarseth 1997) unpacks some territory that speak directly to some of the great questions raised in your Case Study presnetations such as "in what sense can a hypertext be a narrative? Is hypertext a literary genre or a literary technique?" It introduces the important concept of "ergotics": "hypertext is not a reconfiguration of narrative but offers an alternative to it, as I try to demonstrate through the concept of ergodics." (p.95)

- What do you think of Aarseth's concept? explain how it offer an alternative to conventional ideas of narrative and the role of reader and writer?

Regarding our discussion about new terms and concents for thinking beyond binaries: author/reader text/audience ficion/fact etc, and genres or 'silos': novel, poetry, essay, memoir, literature, art, game etc    
- deleuze and the 'rhizome' from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)) I will an optional extended reading for anyone interesting in this idea
- new media art [rhizome.org](https://rhizome.org)

  ### In Class

- How could you plan hypertext fiction?

- ### Toward Assessment 2
- Proposals discussion and reflections in folio **Required Activity for Final Folio**
  
- What is emerging for you in terms of your own piece toward Assessment 2 and 3
- What platform and technology does it require?
- Do you know already if you can make it?
- What else do you need to learn in order to execute your vision for this piece?
- **map your thoughts any way you like - use miro, use a corkboard, a table in a word doc, ppowerpoint, post it notes, whatever. If you use a physical medium take photos and pop them in a sharefolder linked to your Github folio.** 

## Week 6

## Monday class - 7th April

Today we will begin class with any remaining Assessment 1 Case Study Presesentations.

Please be prepared to discuss how you are tracking with the class and the coursework so far. Think about what tools you need to do your main project for the class. 

Today we will continue our work with Twine - beginning with [inserting audio](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-twine.md#adding-audio) and then continuing on with styling images. 

If there is time today, we will cover [image maps in Twine](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-twine.md#image-maps), however, we can slow down to address any tech challenges that people are facing so far. If you feel uncertain about anything, chances are that other people are having the same difficulty. Please make sure to ask questions now, so that you have ample time to prepare for the second Assessment.

If you miss class today, please be sure to follow along learning about audio, image styling and image maps using the [Twine resources](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-twine.md). You can follow along with this [video recording](https://www.loom.com/embed/8ec5d97f6c1c4683adec6439049d33f2?sid=f0d64dfd-6e97-484c-9383-fd4b16670fdc) which walks you through the process step-by-setp. **You will be expected to make a minimum effort with image styling, audio and image maps in Twine for your folio, even if you do not choose Twine as the platform for your project.** 

Once we have completed a test image map - basic is okay, no need to overdo it! - then if you have attended all the classes so far and/or have otherwise kept up with the learning, the good news is that there is no more **required** new technology for you to learn. 

**Next Monday the tech content around writing games using platforms such as Bitsy and Inform 7 is optional. If you do not include those in your portfolio, you will not be penalised.** 

As we continue progressing towards Assessments 2 and 3, we will work with the tech tools that we have already been exposed to. There will be time during future classes, for example, for us to complete the author website portion of the folio requirement. 

## Wednesday class - 9th April

Please note that if you missed the Monday class or need further guidance on creating an image map, you can watch this new [video recording](https://www.loom.com/embed/8ec5d97f6c1c4683adec6439049d33f2?sid=f0d64dfd-6e97-484c-9383-fd4b16670fdc) as you follow the directions in the [Twine resources](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-twine.md). A special thank you to Angelo for demonstrating the image map functionality in class.


**Toward Assessment 2 (and 3) activity and discussion** 
1. See the slide deck on Canvas modules [Student Works 2024](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/146513/pages/student-works-2024?module_item_id=7255750). These are three successful examples of developed digital works and they are all very different. 
 
2. Critically reflect on these works by asking the same sort of questions as you asked of the case study Ass 1:
- How does it work? What does it do? How does the reader interact with the piece? What is conveyed by the digital work?
- How does the digital affordance work with the piece’s themes? Does its function deepen the meaning and interpretation of the themes for you as a reader? 
- Think about: the relationship between imagery and text; how the text changes between readings; how movement acts in the work; the structure of the work; the technologies used.
- How does this work make you reflect on your own ideas and what you might do for your own piece? **Requirement for final folio write 250 to 300 (minimum) words on this (can be done any time this week)** 

3. See the slide deck on Canvas modules [Jenny's Final Project](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/146513/pages/jennys-final-project-2021)
- Read the contextual statements and consider how the form and function of each aspect of this piece feeds into the themes of the work.
- See the map of Jenny's Twine story on Slide 8. How might you map your own emerging ideas? (If you have not already done the mapping exrcise from last week please catch up on this.)  
 
## Week 7

### Monday class – 14th April

Today we will look at interactive fiction in games. You are not required to include games code from today in your folio. We understand that you have experimented with so much code already. 

We will play through a number of Bitsy examples (which will be added to the repo later) and reflect on the affordances of tiny games.

#### Class discussion

- How does Bitsy's technical constraint of 8x8 pixel art and limited colour palettes affect narrative possibilities and expression? In particular, how have these been used to elicit emotional response to themes around memory and grief?
- In what ways do spatial navigation and environmental storytelling function differently in Bitsy games compared to other e-lit forms? What does this ask of the reader/player?
- How can we make use various game features (e.g., character interactions triggering text, having scenes “loop” differently with each subsequent play) to make a game “literary”, with a compelling emotional timbre?

We will play with the online Bitsy Game Maker, drawing upon our new [games resources page](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-games.md). 

Since [Assessment Two](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/class-handbook.md#task-2-proposal-25) is coming up, think about whether there is any tech that you need to know to make your creative prototype for your presentation. We will have time in class today to troubleshoot any of the coding that we have covered so far.
