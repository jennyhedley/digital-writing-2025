- Mollie Houlihan - [Kaitlyn's Blog](https://kaitlyns-blog.glitch.me/)
A website-based piece of interactive fiction for ARG and mystery fans alike, Kaitlyn’s Blog is an interactive mystery in which you must find the answer to your girlfriend’s years-old disappearance. Utilising hidden links, codes, and secret messages, this piece of interactive fiction will have you navigate the increasingly complex maze that’s hidden beneath the many layers that makes up the gentle façade that has become Kaitlyn’s Blog.

- Jordan Templar - [Shifted](https://pieofepicness.github.io/final-twine-project-3/)

A Control/Remedy Gaming Universe fanwork, it tells the story of Maya Chowdhury, who gets taken by one of the Oldest House’s building shifts, and she has to find a way out or remain lost forever.

#### Coming of Age
- Upani Perara – [Through the Front Door](https://upanicp.github.io/major-project/)

Lead your character through their childhood, where they will confront elements of their past. The character – someone who is disillusioned by adulthood – reconciles their romanticised past with their mediocre present. Explores themes of nostalgia, coming-of-age, and a person and place being haunted by their past.

- Emily Vandenbroeck - [On Vanity](https://emilyvandenbroeck.github.io/on-vanity-comparison/)

#### Travel/Personal Archive
- Marley Abbott - [The Tank](https://marleyabbott.github.io/the-tank-1/)

The Tank is an interactive digital work created in Twine, tracing a protagonist's journey through their family's village in Southern Italy. Written in second person, it weaves between present-day experiences of visiting Santo Todaro for the first time and memories passed down through generations, using family photographs, soundscape, and interactive elements to explore what it means to return to a place you've never been but have experienced through inheritance.
