- Liv D - [Who Killed Miss Jones?](https://livdelesantis.github.io/digital-writing-twine/)

In 'Who Killed Miss Jones?', the small, rural Victorian town of Sentry Creek is brimming with dirty secrets. It's been 40 years since the unexplained disappearance of school-teacher Daphne Marie Jones. Playing as a cold-case detective, you are sent from the Metropolitan Police to re-examine four eyewitness accounts - provided by four teenage girls around the time of Daphne's disappearance. You must solve riddles upon riddles, dissect lies and discover hidden clues to answer the titular question: Who Killed Miss Jones? And more importantly...why? A world of psychological horror, disturbing twists and eerily authentic characters await. Who is lying to you, who is telling the truth? Can you find the correct answer and solve the decades-long mystery?

- Charlotte B [How to Use a Lift](https://charlotteburnett.github.io/How-to-Use-a-Lift/)

‘How to Use a Lift’ is a digital interactive fiction work created using Twine. It beckons readers to operate the elevator of a mysterious tower and successfully navigate to their desired destination. Readers can decide if they will follow the instructions provided by the narrator, or if instead, they explore their own anxious doubts and the trickles of surrealism that arrive with every floor.

#### Coming of Age
- Upani P – [Through the Front Door](https://upanicp.github.io/major-project/)

Lead your character through their childhood, where they will confront elements of their past. The character – someone who is disillusioned by adulthood – reconciles their romanticised past with their mediocre present. Explores themes of nostalgia, coming-of-age, and a person and place being haunted by their past.

- Emily V - [On Vanity and the Art of Comparison](https://emilyvandenbroeck.github.io/on-vanity-comparison/)

On Vanity and the Art of Comparison is a personal exploration of the concept of vanity and comparison in a world in which identity extends beyond that of the physical world and into the digital; a world in which your identity is often assumed upon by style or body type or facial features. It asks whether it is possible to reject the idea of vanity in such a society, and highlights the average young woman’s experience of vanity from childhood through to early adulthood. How does one’s perception of self-change throughout these integral life stages? You will be taken through three life stages, and how you choose to experience each of these is up to you.                                         

- Lani S - [Reflection](https://lanisalt.github.io/assignment-two/) *Site under construction as of 19/6*

My piece, ‘Reflections’ is an anthology of who I am as a person. The final work includes poems, social media posts, diary entries and other bits of intentional and unintentional bits of writing from around the time I collected them, which is meant to match the bricolage aspect of the mirror and contextualise each artifact. You progress through the story by clicking on the different images on the mirror, ‘unlocking’ more writing as you go.

The Tank is an interactive digital work created in Twine, tracing a protagonist's journey through their family's village in Southern Italy.
